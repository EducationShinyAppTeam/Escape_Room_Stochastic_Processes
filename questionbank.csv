"Sixty percent of the customers at a bakery buy one loaf of bread, 10 percent buy two, and the remaining 30% don't buy any bread at all.  Let \(P_n\) represent the probability that the bakery has sold an even number of loaves to the first n customers. ",The value of \(P_1\) is . . .,0.6,0.4,0.1,0.5,0.4

"Alexis, James, and Liang are playing catch with a frisbee.  When Alexis has the frisbee she throws it to James or Liang each half the time.  When either James or Liang have the frisbee, they throw it to Alexis a proportion p of the time (0 < p < 1).","In this case the transition probability matrix for the states denoted A, J, and L respectively is given by:",\(\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\p & 0 & 1-p \\  1 & 0.5 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\),\(\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\p & 1 & 1-p \\  p & 1-p & 1 \end{bmatrix}\),\(\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\0.5 & 0 & 0.5 \\  0.5 & 0.5 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\),\(\begin{bmatrix}p & 0.5 & 0.5 \\p & 0.5 & 0.5 \\  p & 0.5 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\),\(\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\p & 0 & 1-p \\  1 & 0.5 & 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\)

"Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a type of bacteria that causes a respiratory disease in both domestic birds like chickens and also wild birds like house finches.  Birds can be either susceptible (S), infected (I) with the disease or may die from the disease or another cause (D).  House finches around Ithaca New York were studied once a week by ornithologists from Cornell University and the following transition probability matrix was found to apply to the three states S, I, and D: \(\begin{bmatrix}0.9 & 0.05 & 0.05\\0.1 & 0.7 & 0.2 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}\)","In this population, what is the probability that a susceptible bird would be infected the following week",0.03,0.2,0,1,0.03
